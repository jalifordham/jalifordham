  <div class="desc">The way we perceive the things we see such as art, in fact, especially art depends heavily on our backgrounds and the norms of our cultures and societies. We process what we see based on our own experiences, in some ways, this can make our ideas about what certain art and paintings are about very arbitrary. </div>

  <div class="desc"> Berger suggests that viewing art and learning art history has been overtly mystified in order to compensate for the loss of sacredness that inevitably happened with the invention of the camera and new abilities to replicate and view art from anywhere.  </div>

  <div class="desc">Theories of artists and art have been made highly inaccessible as if almost belonging exclusively to upper-class people of academia. Bergerâ€™s mission to demystify these works is an important one. Art does not exclusively belong to anyone except the artist and the viewing of art should not be made to seem like an elite activity.</div>

  <div class="desc">The topic of women in art and the symbol of the female body in art has always been a center of discussion especially in classical painting. It is rarely asked of women to identify with them and speak on their personal feelings towards them. It may be because there is a fear that if we do ask women, they will actually say they do not connected with these idealized figures. </div>
