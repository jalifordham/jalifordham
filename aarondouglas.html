	Aaron Douglas, was born in 1899 in Topeka Kansas and is known as one of the most accomplished and influential visual artists of the Harlem Renaissance. Douglas was referred to as “the father of Black American art” and came to fame during the New Negro Movement in the 1920s with his mural paintings and illustrations that addressed social issues around race and segregation in the U.S. by using African-centric imagery. Douglas is also known for his time working as a professor at historically black universities in the 1930s and 1940s.
